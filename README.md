# MPC Millionaires

Alice, Bob and Charlie are all millionaires.

The would like to know their total wealth and 
how they compare to each other over 3 years,
**without** disclosing their wealth to each other.

This is a somewhat more elaborated version of the famous 
[Yao's Millionaires' problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_problem) which
demonstrates the ability of CipherCompute to perform calculations mixing arithmetic and non-linear
operations.

## Hack it !

The code is heavily documented and under MIT license as it is meant to be hacked for your purpose.

It is actually very easy to generalize this code for all confidential Key Performance Indicators 
comparisons across entities with minor modifications.

Do not hesitate to open issues or PRs to improve the quality of this code 
and its documentation.
